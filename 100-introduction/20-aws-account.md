In order to actually do something with AWS services, you need an AWS account. Furthermore, you need an IAM user for this account that you can use to log into the AWS Management Console, so that you can provision and configure you resources.

[AWS Identity and Access Managment (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.

#### BYOA - bring your own account

The regular case is that you have to bring your own AWS account, configured with an IAM user with administrator privileges. If possible, this should be a vanilla account.

{{% notice warning %}}
If you bring your own account, either personal or a company account, make sure you understand the implications and policy of provisioning resources into this account.

If you don't have an AWS account yet, and you want to repeat this workshop for yourself later, you can [create a free account here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup) or ask your company's Cloud Center of Excellence to create one for you.

#### Create an administrator user

In case you want to use your own account now or later, and you don't yet have an IAM user with administrator privileges, you need to create one.
